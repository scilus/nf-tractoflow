  Subworkflow to perform registration between a moving and a fixed image (e.g. T1 -> DWI).
  It requires as input at least a moving (ch_image) and a reference (ch_ref) image to properly
  perform registration. Three modes are available:
  1)  if a metric file is supplied (ch_metric), the subworkflow will use the REGISTER_ANATTODWI
      module calling AntsRegistration, with the metric as additional target.
  2)  if NO metric file is supplied, the subworkflow will use the REGISTRATION_ANTS module calling
      antsRegistrationSyN.sh or antsRegistrationSyNQuick.sh.
  3)  alternatively, if an alternative model parameter is activated, the subworkflow will use the specified module
  This subworkflow outputs transformation files that can be used with the ANTSAPPLYTRANSFORMS module
  to warp any new image. Simply provide your moving image, reference image, and transformations files
  to the module to register a new image in the current space. Similar steps can be used to register
  bundles/tractograms using the BUNDLEREGISTRATION module.

input:
  - ch_image:
      type: file
      description: |
        The input channel containing the moving image files. Typically your anatomical image to be
        registered to dwi space.
        Structure: [ val(meta), path(image) ]
      pattern: "*.{nii,nii.gz}"
  - ch_ref:
      type: file
      description: |
        The input channel containing the fixed image files. Typically a reference image from the dwi
        space (e.g. b0 image, etc.).
        Structure: [ val(meta), path(ref) ]
      pattern: "*.{nii,nii.gz}"
  - ch_metric:
      type: file
      description: |
        The input channel containing the metric files. Supplying this channel will make the subworkflow
        use the module REGISTER_ANATTODWI calling AntsRegistration using the moving, reference and metric
        image. For a T1 -> DWI registration, this is typically a FA map.
        Structure: [ val(meta), path(metric) ]
      pattern: "*.{nii,nii.gz}"
  - ch_mask:
      type: file
      description: |
        The input channel containing the mask files. Supplying this channel only affect the subworkflow
        if the ch_metric is NOT supplied. This channel is only being used if the module called is
        REGISTRATION_ANTS, see the description section above for more details.

  - ch_segmentation:
      type: file
      description: |
        The input channel containing the the SynthSeg v2 (non-robust) segmentation + parcellation of the moving (floating in Easyreg naming convention) image.
        If it does not exist, Easyreg will create it. If it already exists (e.g., from a previous EasyReg run),
        then EasyReg will read it from disk (which is faster than segmenting).
      pattern: "*.{nii,nii.gz}"

      description: |
        The input channel containing the SynthSeg v2 (non-robust) segmentation + parcellation of the fixed (reference in Easyreg naming convention) image.

  - image_warped:

      description: |
        Channel containing warped moving images. Typically, this would be the warped T1 in DWI space.

      pattern: "*.{nii,nii.gz}"
  - transfo_image:
      type: file
      description: |
        Channel containing the image transformation files. This channel contains the necessary transformation
        files (warp and affine) to perform the anatomical -> dwi space registration. Those files could be
        used in the future to bring anatomical labels into DWI space for connectomics.
        Structure: [ val(meta), [ path(warp), <path(affine)> ] ]
      pattern: "*.{nii,nii.gz,mat}"
  - transfo_trk:
      type: file
      description: |
        Channel containing the tractogram transformation files. This channel contains the necessary transformation
        files (inverseAffine, inverseWarp) to perform the dwi -> anatomical space registration. Those files could
        be used to register tractograms or bundle in the subject's anatomical space.
        Structure: [ val(meta), [ <path(inverseAffine)>, path(inverseWarp) ]
      pattern: "*.{nii,nii.gz,mat}"
  - ref_warped:

      description: |
        Channel containing warped reference image. Typically, this would be the warped DWI in T1 space.

        Channel containing the file with the SynthSeg v2 (non-robust) segmentation + parcellation of the fixed (reference in Easyreg naming convention) image.
